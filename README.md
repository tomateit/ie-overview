WIP

Overview of IE methods and approaches.

My goal is mostly to get a shallow understanding of possibilities, that modern tools provide.

TODO:
1. Try Spacy matcher for SPO triplets
2. OpenIE6 overview (https://github.com/dair-iitd/OpenIE-standalone)
3. https://github.com/philipperemy/stanford-openie-python
4. https://github.com/knowitall/reverb
...
99. Make some sort of a demo

Currently keep an eye on `notebooks` folder, all other files are just to scaffold further development.
